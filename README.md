# Quadratic-Equation-Solver
"Quadratic Equation Solver" is an application used to solve quadratic equations.

### Executable File

The executable file "Quadratic_Equation_Solver.exe" is used to run the application. It is available in
https://github.com/DtjiSoftwareDeveloper/Quadratic-Equation-Solver/blob/main/executable/Quadratic_Equation_Solver.exe.

### Source Code

Java code used to create the application is available in
https://github.com/DtjiSoftwareDeveloper/Quadratic-Equation-Solver/blob/main/code/Main.java.

### Getting Started

Once you run the application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) window with text fields to enter the coefficients of x ^ 2 and x and
a constant value together with text areas for x ^ 2, x, and the roots and the button "SOLVE" will be shown.
